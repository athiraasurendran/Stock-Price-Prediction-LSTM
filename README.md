# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to forecast stock prices of 25 companies using deep learning and Streamlit for visualization.

---

## Project Highlights

- Forecast next 7 days of stock closing prices
- Used data from Yahoo Finance (2010–2025)
- Final accuracy (Amazon example):  
  - MSE: 7.81  
  - MAE: 2.05  
  - R²: 0.998  
- Visualize actual vs predicted prices
- Direction movement (up/down) detection

## Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- TensorFlow & Keras (LSTM model)  
- yfinance (stock data)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, ploly  
- Streamlit (web app)
